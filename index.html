    Add a Bootstrap navigation bar and modify it to have:
    - Bob's Burgers instead of Navbar, pointing to index.html
    - Menu as the first link, pointing to menu.html
    - About Us as the second link, pointing to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob%27s_Burgers
    - All other links/features should be deleted
    - Navbar should be consistent across the two pages
